<p id="top">Infosys was established by seven engineers in Pune, Maharashtra, India with an initial capital of $250 in 1981.[7] It was registered as Infosys Consultants Private Limited on 2 July 1981.[8] In 1983, it relocated its office to Bangalore, Karnataka, India.

The company changed its name to Infosys Technologies Private Limited in April 1992 and to Infosys Technologies Limited when it became a public limited company in June 1992. It was later renamed to Infosys Limited in June 2011.[9]

An initial public offer (IPO) in February 1993 with an offer price of ₹95 (equivalent to ₹510 or US$7.20 in 2018) per share against book value of ₹20 (equivalent to ₹110 or US$1.50 in 2018) per share was undersubscribed but it was "bailed out" by US investment bank Morgan Stanley, which picked up 13% of equity at the offer price.[10] Its shares were listed in stock exchanges in June 1993 with trading opening at ₹145 (equivalent to ₹790 or US$11 in 2018) per share.[11]

Its shares were listed on NASDAQ in 1999 through ADR route. The share price surged to ₹8,100 (equivalent to ₹26,000 or US$360 in 2018) by 1999 making it the costliest share on the market at the time. At that time, Infosys was among the 20 biggest companies by market capitalization on the NASDAQ.[10] The ADR listing was shifted from NASDAQ to NYSE Euronext to give its European investors better access to its stock.[12]Infosys Q3 net profit rises 23.7% to Rs 4,466cr in the month of january 2020 even after all the whistleblower complaints which was not proven after investigation.

Its annual revenue reached US$100 million in 1999, US$1 billion in 2004 and US$10 billion in 2017.[8]

In 2012, Infosys announced a new office in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to serve Harley-Davidson, being the 18th international office in the United States.[13][14] Infosys hired 1,200 United States employees in 2011, and expanded the workforce by an additional 2,000 employees in 2012.[14] In April 2018 Infosys announced expanding in Indianapolis, Indiana. The development will include more than 120 acres and is expected to result in 3,000 new jobs—1,000 more than previously announced.

In July 2014, Infosys started a product subsidiary called EdgeVerve Systems, focusing on enterprise software products for business operations, customer service, procurement and commerce network domains.[15] In August 2015, the Finacle Global Banking Solutions assets were officially transferred from Infosys and became part of the product company EdgeVerve Systems product portfolio.
Bengaluru: Infosys Ltd has received a second whistleblower complaint accusing chief executive Salil Parekh of misdemeanours, days after a similar letter prompted the company’s board to institute an independent probe.

The second whistleblower urged the chairman and directors to act against Parekh.

“Though it is a year and eight months since Parekh joined the company, he operates from Mumbai in violation of the condition that the CEO has to be based in Bengaluru. What is stopping the board to insist on his movement to Bengaluru," said the whistleblower in the unsigned letter to Infosys chairman and co-founder Nandan Nilekani and independent directors.

Claiming to be an employee in the $11-billion company’s finance department, the whistleblower said he was unable to disclose his identity fearing retaliation for the damning disclosures he was making against Parekh. “I am an employee working in the finance department. I am submitting this whistleblower complaint as the matter is so volatile that I fear retaliation if I disclose my identity. Please excuse me for the same, but the matter is of grave importance."
As an employee and a shareholder, the whistleblower said it was his duty to bring to the notice of the chairman and the board a few facts that were eroding the value systems of the company.

Accusing Parekh of visiting Bengaluru from Mumbai at least twice a month, the employee said: “As all our employees are paying for their transport from their homes to office and back, expecting the same from the CEO is not wrong. Please initiate actions to recover this money from Salil Parekh immediately."

When the first letter became public on 22 October, shares of Infosys tumbled about 16% to close at ₹643.55 on the BSE.

Since then, the stock has recovered 9.5%, while the Sensex gained 3.54%. The markets are closed on Tuesday on account of Guru Nanak Jayanti.

However, the second letter, a copy of which was reviewed by Mint, may not be new.

It could be the one of the “undated letters" that Infosys had referred to earlier. In a statement on 22 October, Nilekani had acknowledged that a board member had received two anonymous complaints on 30 September—one dated 20 September titled “Disturbing unethical practices", and the second undated “Whistleblower Complaint".

When contacted, an Infosys spokesperson said the company has “nothing more to share at this point in time".

Infosys co-founder N.R. Narayana Murthy declined to comment on the ongoing issues of corporate governance in the company. Such questions should be raised with Infosys, he told Mint on the sidelines of a book launch event at the company’s Electronic City headquarters in Bengaluru. Murthy and family still hold about 3.54% stake in Infosys out of the total promoter and promoter group holding of 13.15%.</p>
